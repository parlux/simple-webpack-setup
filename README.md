# Simple Webpack Setup

Just a simple setup of webpack with a dev server, linting, and separate mocha unit tests. Mostly based off this awesome article [http://blog.madewithlove.be/post/webpack-your-bags/](http://blog.madewithlove.be/post/webpack-your-bags/)

#### Run dev server
`npm i`
`./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server`

#### Run tests
`mocha tests`
